for subset , subsequence or in subarray when we pass the temp or storing array 
by address then it is required to backtrack means pop_back() to undo the change


The Thinking process for subset and subsequence or we say code structure are same for both ,
but for SubArray there is difference in Thinking process as well as code structure 
in this we can call one function  simply because we have add one element but when we are 
going to add another element we have to check for if temp array is empty i.e this is first 
element or last element add in temp and the privious element from orginal array are same
then we can push element and call second function
