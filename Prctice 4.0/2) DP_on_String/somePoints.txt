Here also the thinking and logic are same for the both subset of string and subsequence 
of string but there are difference in substring is that we print the stirng from start
to end and call start+1 below function and if start>end then we rest the start to 0 
and end+1 and return 

We are try to print all the substring from start to end and when start goes ahead of end then 
we increment the end and reset start to 0 and again print all substring from start to end this 
process goes on untill end reach to orginal string size then we return the function.
